# a repo of fun things I wrote

This is just a catch-all where I put stuff that doesn't have a place.

## /bash

#### temp.sh
I am dating an American and I am terrible at temperature conversion.

Usage: You can put it in `/usr/local/bin` and `chmod +x temp.sh` to make it executable from anywhere, or just run it with the full path. Then: `temp.sh <flag> <degrees>`, where `flag` is either `-c` or `-f` (units to convert to), and `degrees` is the value you're converting from.

For example: `temp.sh -c 32` would return 0.
